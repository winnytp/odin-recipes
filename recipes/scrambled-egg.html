    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Soft and creamy scrambled eggs, cooked to perfection.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to pan and pre-heat on a gentle heat. Never use a warm or hot temperature.</li>
        <li>In a pan, crack 4 eggs and whisk briskly with fork until thoroughly beaten.</li>
        <li>When pan is slightly heated, but NOT hot, add in eggs. (This is important to avoid overcooking.)</li>
        <li>Slowly stir eggs every 30 seconds while on a gentle heat. Do not allow to stick together, or they will turn rubbery.</li>
        <li>Once eggs are <em>almost</em> at desired texture, turn off heat and transfer eggs to plate immediately.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper (to taste) and serve with toast.</li>
    </ol>
